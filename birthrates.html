    <h1>Global Birth Rates Are Falling — And the World Isn’t Ready</h1>

    <p>
      Over the past 60 years, the global birth rate has declined by nearly 50%, dropping from 36.4 births per 1,000 people in 1960 to just 18.5 in 2020.
      This significant decrease is changing the face of societies worldwide — from the composition of workforces to the design of social welfare systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org" target="_blank" class="source-link">World Bank</a>, this trend stems from industrialization,
      urbanization, and increased education among women. Developed nations like South Korea (with a fertility rate of just 0.72 in 2023) are well below
      the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Japan, Italy, and Germany face similar declines with rapidly aging populations. Meanwhile, emerging markets are beginning to follow suit as they
      modernize. In the U.S., the birth rate dropped from 14.4 per 1,000 in 2000 to 11.0 in 2022.

    <p>
      The consequences are profound. Fewer workers means fewer contributors to pension and healthcare systems. Schools may close while eldercare demand
      surges. Industries will be forced to adapt or shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population" target="_blank" class="source-link">United Nations</a> projects that by 2050, one in six
      people globally will be over 65 (up from one in eleven in 2019). Countries are testing solutions like incentivized childbirth, expanded immigration,
      and automation to offset shrinking workforces.

      <h2>Global Forecasts by Region</h2>
      <p>
        The United Nations forecasts that countries like Japan and South Korea could lose more than 50% of their populations by 2100 if current
        fertility trends continue. The ripple effects will impact global markets, migration patterns, and political alliances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to see population booms. Nigeria is projected to become the world's third-largest country by 2050.
        This shift may change global power dynamics and economic priorities.

      <h2>Wall Street Journal Insight</h2>
      <p>
        In a 2024 feature, the <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong> connected falling birth rates to GDP slowdowns across G7 nations. One visualization
        projected that by 2060, shrinking populations could significantly drag on economic output if labor gaps remain unaddressed.

        The map below highlights projected global birth rates by 2050. Countries in dark blue are expected to fall significantly below replacement
        rate, while lighter regions indicate areas with stable or growing populations.
